# Unity

Unity is a cross-platform tool for developing video games and applications, as well as the engine on which they run. Applications created with Unity run on desktop computer systems, mobile devices and gaming consoles in 2D and 3D graphics, and on virtual or augmented reality devices. This makes it possible to create a wide variety of games: from simple and one-word scenarios with a couple of triggers to more structured, complex and well-thought-out games
